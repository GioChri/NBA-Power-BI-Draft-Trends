NBA Draft and Trends Data Visualization Project 

Over the last few months, I worked on an advanced data visualization project using Power BI, focusing on analyzing NBA draft data and trends. The project involved creating 15+ dynamic and interactive visualizations that explored key aspects such as:

🏅 Conference Comparison

🔄 Team Draft Strategies

🏹 Player Position Trends

🌍 USA vs. International Draft Trend

Through this project, I sharpened my skills in designing impactful visuals to uncover meaningful patterns and insights in sports data. It was an exciting opportunity to combine my passion for sports with data analytics, and I’m proud of the results!

⚠️ Note: This project was created for educational purposes, and while the dataset is not entirely accurate, the focus was on the quality and design of visualizations.
